# MemoryMessageOptimizer

<h3> Memory Optimization Script for 2D Memory Buffer

1) Reads input files from given directory, parses message element regions, ignores non-message space.
2) Computes current inefficiency of memory utilization (i.e. wasted character space and lines)
3) Optimizes the current configuration (optimization is a local maximum, does not guarantee a global maximum)
4) Data Visualization - Displays plot indicating: Current Efficiency, Optimized Efficiency, and Perfect Memory Utilization
5) Automatically generates files with message elements in optimized configuration
